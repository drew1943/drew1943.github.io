            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>This website serves as a growing portfolio for my work in the Web Programming course. 
                It presents the progress of my learning in a simple and organized way so visitors can see how each assignment has added new features and skills. 
                The site includes information about my interests as well as pages that display images, links, multimedia content, form design, and other examples of what I have built. 
                As the course continues, the website will expand and gain more detail so it becomes a complete demonstration of my development and understanding of web design. 
                Visitors can expect a clear layout, creative styling based on the Rubik cube theme, and new updates as each unit is completed.
            <br>The theme of the website centers on Rubik cubes because I have always enjoyed puzzles and problem solving. 
                The cube represents the type of challenge that keeps me engaged, since every twist can reveal a new path to the goal. 
                I chose this theme for the site because it reflects the same type of curiosity and patience that web development requires. 
                As visitors explore the pages, the colors of the cube appear throughout the layout to create a playful and recognizable style. 
                The theme also serves as a reminder that learning to build a website is similar to solving a puzzle, since each new concept connects to another until everything fits together in a complete design.

        <!-- Personal info -->
         <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am learning how to build websites and this portfolio will hold all of my work for the course. 
        I am gaining confidence with HTML and CSS because I enjoy seeing visual changes as I develop each part of the site. 
        It is amazing seeing how much I can do if I put my mind towards creating somthing like this.
        I also like having a place where my projects stay organized in one location.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of class, I spend time working, exploring new interests, and staying active with my hobbies. 
        I enjoy spending some of my free time with my friends and reading. 
        I have always been interested in puzzles. I solved my first Rubiks Cube when I was seven and it was an amazing feeling when I completed it.
        These activities keep me curious and help me enjoy the learning process because I can connect new skills with things that matter to me. 
        This webpage will grow as the course continues and it will become a complete 
        example of what I can create with web programming tools.
