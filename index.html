         <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am learning how to build websites and this portfolio will hold all of my work for the course. 
        I am gaining confidence with HTML and CSS because I enjoy seeing visual changes as I develop each part of the site. 
        It is amazing seeing how much I can do if I put my mind towards creating somthing like this.
        I also like having a place where my projects stay organized in one location.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of class, I spend time working, exploring new interests, and staying active with my hobbies. 
        I enjoy spending some of my free time with my friends and reading. 
        These activities keep me curious and help me enjoy the learning process because I can connect new skills with things that matter to me. 
        This webpage will grow as the course continues and it will become a complete 
        example of what I can create with web programming tools.
